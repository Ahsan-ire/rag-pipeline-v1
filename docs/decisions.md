**Current phase: 1 — ingestion v2 (page-aware, cleaned)**

---

## D1 — pdfplumber retained for extraction (2 Jul 2026)
**Decision:** keep pdfplumber rather than switching to PyMuPDF.
**Why:** it already works, the corpus has a usable OCR text layer, and switching
libraries mid-deadline buys marginal speed for real churn.
**Rejected:** PyMuPDF (faster, but migration risk); re-OCR with OCRmyPDF
(only if Phase 0 QA shows the existing text layer is bad).
**Consequence:** revisit only if extraction QA fails.

## D2 — Page-aware ingestion replaces one-Document-per-PDF (2 Jul 2026)
**Decision:** ingest returns (clean_text, page_map) with per-page character
offsets instead of joining all pages into a single Document.
**Why:** the old design destroyed page numbers at birth, making page-level
citations permanently impossible — and citations are the product.
**Rejected:** one Document per page (fragments paragraphs at page breaks —
the original scaffold was right to avoid this, wrong to lose the page info).
**Consequence:** chunker gains page_start/page_end via offset lookup.

## D3 — Chunker strategies routed by document type (2 Jul 2026)
**Decision:** add a `handbook` chunking strategy (Chapter N / decimal-numbered
paragraphs); retain the `legislation` strategy (PART / Section); route on
document_type.
**Why:** experiment on 2 Jul proved the legislation patterns match nothing in
handbook-style text — the whole book fell through to naive fixed-size splitting
with empty section metadata, silently.
**Rejected:** one universal regex set (false positives; untestable);
deleting the legislation strategy (it's correct for its document type and
already tested).
**Consequence:** each strategy gets its own fixture-based tests; structural
patterns anchor to line starts, case-sensitive.

## D4 — Chunk unit: numbered paragraph, merged/split to 150–1,000 tokens (2 Jul 2026)
**Decision:** one chunk per numbered handbook paragraph; merge runts within a
section, split oversized via the existing fallback splitter with metadata
inheritance.
**Why:** aligns chunk boundaries with the author's own meaning boundaries —
avoids both diluted mega-chunks and orphaned fragments.
**Rejected:** fixed-size splitting (loses structure); whole-section chunks
(diluted vectors on long sections).
**Consequence:** chunk size becomes a tunable verified in Phase 5 eval.

## D5 — Embeddings: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 baseline, recorded in collection (2 Jul 2026)
**Decision:** keep the existing local model; write its name into Chroma
collection metadata and assert it at query time.
**Why:** free, fast on CPU, good enough for a v1 whose quality lever is
chunking+hybrid retrieval, and it keeps the demo runnable by anyone.
**Rejected:** API embedders (cost + key friction for reviewers cloning the
repo); larger local models (slower, marginal gain unproven — eval first).
**Consequence:** corpus and queries share one coordinate system by
construction, not by convention.

## D6 — Hybrid retrieval: BM25 + vector with reciprocal rank fusion (2 Jul 2026)
**Decision:** add BM25 alongside vector search; fuse rankings with RRF.
**Why:** legal queries are exact-token-heavy (section numbers, form names,
statute titles); pure semantic search fuzzes past the literal token that
matters.
**Rejected:** vector-only (the s.68 problem); cross-encoder reranking
(genuine upgrade, but post-submission — see roadmap).
**Consequence:** BM25 index built at index time and persisted next to
chroma_db/.

## D7 — Content-hash chunk IDs (2 Jul 2026)
**Decision:** chunk ID = sha256(chunk_text)[:16], replacing source+index IDs.
**Why:** positional IDs collide with *different* content the moment chunking
changes, so "deduplication" silently preserved stale chunks. Content hashes
make identity mean identity.
**Rejected:** positional IDs (the bug); UUIDs (no dedup at all).
**Consequence:** re-indexing after chunker changes behaves correctly; drops
the private `_collection` API access as a side effect.

## D8 — Thin LangChain layer retained for v1 (2 Jul 2026)
**Decision:** keep langchain-core Documents, the fallback splitter, and the
ChatAnthropic wrapper as-is.
**Why:** it works, it's shallow enough to explain line-by-line, and
de-LangChaining costs days that citations and evals need more.
**Rejected:** rewrite on raw anthropic + chromadb clients (cleaner, genuinely
tempting, not worth 2 days this week).
**Consequence:** revisit post-submission if the framework fights us.

## D9 — Corpus stays out of the public repo (2 Jul 2026)
**Decision:** data/ and *.pdf remain gitignored; repo ships pipeline + tests +
eval harness, framed "bring your own manual." Verified 2 Jul: no sensitive
blob exists anywhere in git history.
**Why:** the handbook is copyrighted; and corpus-agnostic framing makes the
project generalisable — a stronger portfolio claim than a single-book tool.
**Consequence:** README quickstart uses any user-supplied PDF; demo recording
uses the real corpus locally.

## D10 — Extraction QA findings: go/no-go verdict GO (3 Jul 2026)
**Finding (Phase 0 acceptance evidence):** pdfplumber's raw extraction of
`data/Conveyancing_Handbook.pdf` (805 pages) is clean enough to build on with
no OCR garbling observed across 10 randomly sampled pages plus full-corpus
pattern checks: sentences are well-formed, no visible character-level OCR
errors, and no re-OCR pass is warranted. It needs three kinds of cleaning
before chunking. (1) **Header pollution** is real but not literal-repeat:
707/805 pages (88%) open with a running header shaped either
`<ALL-CAPS CHAPTER TITLE> <printed page no.>` or
`<printed page no.> <ALL-CAPS CHAPTER TITLE>` (recto/verso alternation), and
the title text changes every chapter — so `extraction_qa.py`'s repeated-line
report (frequency-based, >10% threshold) found *zero* hits even though
header pollution is on the large majority of pages. Header stripping must be
a **positional regex rule** (first line of page matching the caps+number
shape), not a literal-string-repetition rule. (2) **Hyphenation breaks are
frequent**: 2,682 lines across the corpus end in a lowercase letter followed
by a hyphen, confirming the cross-line hyphen repair CLAUDE.md anticipated.
(3) **Front-matter page-number offset**: the printed page number embedded in
the header differs from pdfplumber's raw page index by a constant +44
throughout the body (e.g. raw page 107 ↔ printed "63"; raw page 762 ↔
printed "718") — front matter (title pages, table of contents, table of
statutes, table of cases, all in roman numerals) accounts for the gap.
Phase 1 must decide whether `page_start`/`page_end` citations surface the
raw PDF page or the book's own printed page number; not resolved here.

**Numbering grammar — invalidates a stated assumption:** the handbook has
**no in-body `Chapter N` (mixed-case) marker** as IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
Phase 2 assumed. The real chapter-start marker is `^CHAPTER \d+$`
(**all-caps**, standalone line, chapter title on the following line) —
confirmed to appear exactly once per chapter, 16 times total, matching the
table of contents. The mixed-case `^Chapter \d+` pattern census'd in this
gate matched only 5 lines, all mid-prose false positives (e.g. "Chapter 13
dealt with the difference between..."), zero real chapter starts — a
case-sensitivity trap in the same family as the PART false-positive (D3),
just inverted: here the fix is matching the caps, not avoiding
over-matching. Decimal paragraph numbering goes **four levels deep**
(`N`, `N.N`, `N.N.N`, `N.N.N.N` — e.g. `1.7.2.1 Formalities for
registration`), deeper than the 3-level `3.2 → 3.2.1` example in CLAUDE.md.
Depth-1 bare numbers (2,035 occurrences) are overwhelmingly noise — years,
street addresses, enumerated-list items ("1. Actual where...", lettered
sub-items), table-of-contents page numbers — and are not usable alone as a
structural signal. Depth-2-and-deeper numbers reliably mark real
section/subsection headings, and the chapter number is recoverable as the
leading integer of any such number (e.g. "9.4 Content of the Mortgage Deed"
belongs to Chapter 9) — so Phase 2 does not need a separate chapter-number
extraction step once section numbers are parsed, only a chapter-*title*
lookup (from the table of contents or the `CHAPTER N` marker pages).

**Verdict:** GO. Proceed to Phase 1 on pdfplumber's existing text layer; no
OCRmyPDF pivot needed. Phase 2's chunker patterns must use `^CHAPTER \d+$`
(all-caps) instead of the mixed-case pattern named in the current plan text.

## D11 — Extraction tooling: pdfplumber retained over Marker/Docling (3 Jul 2026)
**Decision:** keep pdfplumber (extends D1); do not adopt Marker, Docling, or
similar deep-learning PDF-to-Markdown converters, conditional on the Phase 0
extraction QA gate passing (it did — see D10).
**Why:** the corpus already carries a usable OCR text layer, so extraction
means *reading* that layer, not re-OCRing it. pdfplumber does this
deterministically, with zero new dependencies, and gives the per-page
character offsets the page_map/citation design (D2) needs. Marker is a
deep-learning layout+OCR pipeline (Surya models, torch + downloaded weights)
whose throughput is heavily GPU-dependent — real-world reports range from
~0.03 pages/sec on a consumer GPU to ~25 pages/sec on an H100 — the wrong
cost/risk profile for an 800-page book on a laptop a week before freeze. It
would also discard the existing text layer in favour of new model output:
a new, non-deterministic source of error, not a fix for one that was
demonstrated.
**Rejected:** Marker / Docling (GPU-dependent throughput, new dependency
weight, replaces a working text layer with model output); OCRmyPDF
(deferred — only relevant if the gate had failed, which it didn't).
**Consequence:** if a future corpus fails its own extraction QA gate, the
escalation ladder is OCRmyPDF first (re-OCR in place, deterministic, CPU-only),
Marker/Docling only if layout structure itself — not text fidelity — is the
problem.

## D12 — requirements.txt pinned to exact resolved versions, not full freeze (3 Jul 2026)
**Decision:** pin the 13 direct dependencies to the exact versions resolved
in a clean Python 3.12.13 venv (`==`), rather than committing the full
`pip freeze` transitive closure IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md's Phase 0 literally
specifies.
**Why:** a full freeze on macOS-arm64 embeds platform-specific transitive
pins (torch wheels, etc.) that can fail to resolve for a reviewer cloning on
a different OS/architecture — directly hostile to the "fresh-clone
quickstart in ≤5 commands" goal in Phase 6. Pinning only the direct
dependencies still gives fully reproducible, evidenced builds (39/39 tests
passed against these exact pins, including langchain's 0.x → 1.3.11 major
version jump pulled in by the `>=0.3.0` range) without baking in one
machine's platform wheels.
**Rejected:** literal `pip freeze` (platform-fragile transitive pins);
leaving `>=` ranges as-is (the thing Phase 0 explicitly exists to fix —
non-reproducible builds).
**Consequence:** if a reviewer's fresh-clone install (Phase 6) hits a
transitive dependency conflict pip's own resolver can't solve, revisit and
pin the offending transitive package explicitly rather than freezing
everything.
