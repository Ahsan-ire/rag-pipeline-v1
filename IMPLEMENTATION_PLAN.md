# Implementation Plan — Legal RAG Pipeline (v1 → submission)

**Target:** working, evaluated, documented pipeline frozen by **Fri 10 July** (reviewer buffer), submitted **Sun 12 July**. Claude Corps deadline: 17 July.

**Scope discipline:** one corpus (the conveyancing handbook), one job (answer procedure questions with chapter/paragraph/page citations, refuse when out-of-corpus), one interface (CLI). Anything else is post-submission.

**How to use this file:** each phase is one or two Claude Code sessions. Open the session with:
> Read CLAUDE.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. We are doing Phase N. Enter plan mode and propose your approach before touching anything.
Review the plan, challenge it, approve, implement, run the acceptance checks, commit, push.

## Phase 0 — Repo hygiene + go/no-go gate (Thu 2 July, evening, ~1–2h)

1. Commit this file, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/decisions.md` to the repo.
2. Replace the 2-line README with a stub: one-paragraph description, status badge line ("under active development, submission 12 July"), quickstart placeholder.
3. Pin dependencies: `pip freeze` in a clean venv after install, write exact versions to `requirements.txt`.
4. **The gate — extraction QA script** (`scripts/extraction_qa.py`):
   - Opens the real handbook PDF with pdfplumber.
   - Prints N random pages of extracted text alongside page numbers.
   - You eyeball 10 pages against the PDF for: (a) text fidelity (OCR errors?), (b) page furniture polluting the stream (headers/footers/page numbers mid-text?), (c) do section numbers like `3.2.1` survive cleanly at line starts?
   - Also print the set of distinct line-start patterns matching `^\d+(\.\d+)*` and `^Chapter \d+` so we learn the book's real numbering grammar.

**Acceptance:** you can describe, in one paragraph in `docs/decisions.md`, exactly what the raw extracted text looks like and what cleaning it needs. Everything in Phases 1–2 depends on this evidence.

**Go/no-go:** if extraction is garbage (unlikely, since copy-paste works), we pivot to OCRmyPDF re-processing — flag it to Claude immediately.

## Phase 1 — Ingestion v2: page-aware, cleaned (Fri 3 evening + Sat 4 morning)

**Design change:** stop joining all pages into one Document. Instead:

1. Extract per-page, recording `(page_number, char_start, char_end)` offsets into the concatenated text — a **page map**.
2. Cleaning pass, driven by Phase 0 findings, typically:
   - strip running headers/footers (detect lines repeating on >30% of pages),
   - strip standalone page-number lines,
   - repair hyphenation across line breaks (`regis-\ntration` → `registration`),
   - normalise whitespace without destroying paragraph breaks.
3. Return `(clean_text, page_map)` so the chunker can later assign `page_start`/`page_end` to every chunk via offsets.
4. Keep HTML/eISB loaders untouched (off critical path).

**Tests:** unit tests for header/footer stripping, hyphenation repair, and page-map offset correctness on synthetic multi-page input.

**Acceptance:** re-run `extraction_qa.py` on the cleaned output — 10/10 sampled pages clean; a spot-checked sentence's offsets map back to the correct PDF page.

## Phase 2 — Handbook chunker (Sat 4 afternoon + Sun 5)

**Design:** chunker strategies routed by document type (keep the existing legislation strategy; add `handbook`):

1. Patterns from the *real* numbering grammar discovered in Phase 0 — expected shape: `^Chapter \d+` for chapters, `^\d+\.\d+(\.\d+)?\s` for numbered paragraphs. Anchor patterns to line starts; **no IGNORECASE** on structural markers (the `PART` false-positive lesson).
2. Chunk = one numbered paragraph. Merge runt neighbours (< ~150 tokens) within the same section; split oversized ones (> ~1,000 tokens) with the existing fallback splitter, *inheriting* the section metadata.
3. Metadata per chunk: `chapter_number`, `chapter_title`, `section_number` (e.g. "3.2.1"), `heading`, `page_start`, `page_end` (via the page map), plus existing fields.
4. Keep the contextual prefix idea but enrich it: `[Conveyancing Handbook, Ch.3 Registration of Title, para 3.2.1, p.87]`.

**Tests:** feed a realistic handbook-style fixture (chapters + decimal numbering + a prose line starting "Part I of the folio" as a false-positive trap); assert split counts, metadata values, page assignment, runt-merging.

**Acceptance (on the real book):** ≥90% of chunks carry non-empty `section_number`; chunk count is plausible (an 800-page handbook ≈ high hundreds to ~2,000 chunks); you manually verify 10 random chunks' section number **and page number** against the PDF. Record the verified hit rate in `docs/decisions.md`.

## Phase 3 — Retrieval v2: hybrid + storage fixes (Mon 6, evening)

1. **BM25** over the chunk store (`rank_bm25`), built at index time and persisted (pickle alongside `chroma_db/`).
2. **Reciprocal rank fusion** of BM25 and vector rankings (`score = Σ 1/(60 + rank)`); retrieve ~12 from each, fuse, return top-k (default 6).
3. **Fix IDs:** content-hash (`sha256(chunk_text)[:16]`) instead of positional index — re-chunking now correctly re-indexes changed content. Drop the private `_collection` access.
4. Record `embedding_model` in the Chroma collection metadata; assert it matches at query time.

**Tests:** RRF fusion math on synthetic rankings; an exact-token test — a query containing a term that appears verbatim in exactly one chunk must rank that chunk top-3.

**Acceptance:** on the real index, 5 exact-token queries ("priority entry", "s.72 burdens", a Form name, etc.) each retrieve the right paragraph in the top 3.

---

## Phase 4 — Generation polish (Tue 7, evening)

1. Citation format becomes `[Handbook, para 3.2.1, p.87]` sourced from chunk metadata; update the system prompt and the source-extraction regex together.
2. Add a tested **refusal path**: a question the handbook cannot answer ("What is the CGT rate?") must produce an explicit "not covered in the source material" response, not a guess.
3. Surface retrieval scores in CLI output (`--verbose`) so you can see *why* an answer cited what it cited.

**Acceptance:** 3 real questions answered with correct para+page citations verified against the PDF; 2 out-of-corpus questions correctly refused.

---

## Phase 5 — Evaluation harness (Wed 8, evening; write questions at lunch)

1. `eval/golden_set.jsonl` — ~25 questions **you write from your actual work**, each with the expected section number(s). Mix: 15 direct ("what does the handbook say about X"), 5 exact-token, 5 out-of-corpus (expected answer: refusal).
2. `python -m src.pipeline eval` — computes **retrieval hit@k** (expected section in top-k) and refusal accuracy; prints a table; writes `eval/results.md`.
3. One tuning iteration: try chunk-size and k variants, keep the winner, log the numbers.

**Acceptance:** hit@6 ≥ 80% on in-corpus questions; 5/5 refusals correct. If below, the results table tells you whether chunking or retrieval is the culprit — fix the bigger one, re-run, stop. **Do not tune past Wednesday.**

---

## Phase 6 — Portfolio surface (Thu 9, evening)

1. **README rewrite** — the most-read artefact in the repo: what/why (the real workplace problem), architecture diagram (ASCII fine), quickstart that works from `git clone` in ≤5 commands, the eval results table, honest limitations, roadmap (matter-scoped deployment vision).
2. 2–3 minute screen recording: index → ask 3 questions → show citations → show a refusal → show eval output.
3. `docs/decisions.md` complete — every D-entry filled in.
4. Fresh-clone test: new venv, follow your own README verbatim. If it breaks, fix the README.

---

## Freeze + submission track

- **Fri 10:** code freeze. Hand repo + demo to PhD reviewer. Switch fully to essays.
- **Sat 11:** incorporate feedback (docs/small fixes only — no new features), essays final.
- **Sun 12:** submit.

**Parallel track (not optional):** AI Fluency + Claude 101 modules done by **Sun 5**. Essay drafts (community impact: colleagues adopting the S.150 skill; setback: your call) exist by **Wed 8** — a fellowship application is essays *and* project, weighted accordingly.

## Cut list (pre-agreed, in order, if behind schedule)
1. Tuning iteration in Phase 5 (keep the harness, skip optimisation)
2. Refusal-path *tests* (keep the behaviour)
3. BM25 persistence (rebuild index at query time — slower, works)
4. Screen recording (README screenshots instead)

**Never cut:** page-aware citations, the golden set, the README.
