# Implementation Plan — Legal RAG Pipeline (v1 → submission)

**Target (superseded — see "Two-track remediation" after Phase 12):** ~~working, evaluated,
documented pipeline frozen by Fri 10 July, submitted Sun 12 July~~. Following the 11 Jul external
critique, the plan split into two tracks: v1 frozen and tagged `v1.0-baseline` on **Fri 11 July**;
v2 production-hardening (Phases 7–12) targeted for **Sun 13 July**; Claude Corps Fellowship
deadline **17 July** is buffer for the v1-vs-v2 submission decision.

**Scope discipline:** one corpus (the conveyancing handbook), one job (answer procedure questions with chapter/paragraph/page citations, refuse when out-of-corpus), one interface (CLI). Anything else is post-submission.

**How to use this file:** each phase is one or two Claude Code sessions. Open the session with:
> Read CLAUDE.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. We are doing Phase N. Enter plan mode and propose your approach before touching anything.
Review the plan, challenge it, approve, implement, run the acceptance checks, commit, push.

## Phase 0 — Repo hygiene + go/no-go gate (Thu 2 July, evening, ~1–2h)

1. Commit this file, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/decisions.md` to the repo.
2. Replace the 2-line README with a stub: one-paragraph description, status badge line ("under active development, submission 12 July"), quickstart placeholder.
3. Pin dependencies: `pip freeze` in a clean venv after install, write exact versions to `requirements.txt`.
4. **The gate — extraction QA script** (`scripts/extraction_qa.py`):
   - Opens the real handbook PDF with pdfplumber.
   - Prints N random pages of extracted text alongside page numbers.
   - You eyeball 10 pages against the PDF for: (a) text fidelity (OCR errors?), (b) page furniture polluting the stream (headers/footers/page numbers mid-text?), (c) do section numbers like `3.2.1` survive cleanly at line starts?
   - Also print the set of distinct line-start patterns matching `^\d+(\.\d+)*` and `^Chapter \d+` so we learn the book's real numbering grammar.

**Acceptance:** you can describe, in one paragraph in `docs/decisions.md`, exactly what the raw extracted text looks like and what cleaning it needs. Everything in Phases 1–2 depends on this evidence.

**Go/no-go:** if extraction is garbage (unlikely, since copy-paste works), we pivot to OCRmyPDF re-processing — flag it to Claude immediately.

---

## Phase 1 — Ingestion v2: page-aware, cleaned (Fri 3 evening + Sat 4 morning)

**Design change:** stop joining all pages into one Document. Instead:

1. Extract per-page, recording `(page_number, char_start, char_end)` offsets into the concatenated text — a **page map**.
2. Cleaning pass, driven by Phase 0 findings, typically:
   - strip running headers/footers (detect lines repeating on >30% of pages),
   - strip standalone page-number lines,
   - repair hyphenation across line breaks (`regis-\ntration` → `registration`),
   - normalise whitespace without destroying paragraph breaks.
3. Return `(clean_text, page_map)` so the chunker can later assign `page_start`/`page_end` to every chunk via offsets.
4. Keep HTML/eISB loaders untouched (off critical path).

**Tests:** unit tests for header/footer stripping, hyphenation repair, and page-map offset correctness on synthetic multi-page input.

**Acceptance:** re-run `extraction_qa.py` on the cleaned output — 10/10 sampled pages clean; a spot-checked sentence's offsets map back to the correct PDF page.

---

## Phase 2 — Handbook chunker (Sat 4 afternoon + Sun 5)

**Design:** chunker strategies routed by document type (keep the existing legislation strategy; add `handbook`):

1. Patterns from the *real* numbering grammar discovered in Phase 0 — expected shape: `^Chapter \d+` for chapters, `^\d+\.\d+(\.\d+)?\s` for numbered paragraphs. Anchor patterns to line starts; **no IGNORECASE** on structural markers (the `PART` false-positive lesson).
2. Chunk = one numbered paragraph. Merge runt neighbours (< ~150 tokens) within the same section; split oversized ones (> ~1,000 tokens) with the existing fallback splitter, *inheriting* the section metadata.
3. Metadata per chunk: `chapter_number`, `chapter_title`, `section_number` (e.g. "3.2.1"), `heading`, `page_start`, `page_end` (via the page map), plus existing fields.
4. Keep the contextual prefix idea but enrich it: `[Conveyancing Handbook, Ch.3 Registration of Title, para 3.2.1, p.87]`.

**Tests:** feed a realistic handbook-style fixture (chapters + decimal numbering + a prose line starting "Part I of the folio" as a false-positive trap); assert split counts, metadata values, page assignment, runt-merging.

**Acceptance (on the real book):** ≥90% of chunks carry non-empty `section_number`; chunk count is plausible (an 800-page handbook ≈ high hundreds to ~2,000 chunks); you manually verify 10 random chunks' section number **and page number** against the PDF. Record the verified hit rate in `docs/decisions.md`.

---

## Phase 3 — Retrieval v2: hybrid + storage fixes (Mon 6, evening)

1. **BM25** over the chunk store (`rank_bm25`), built at index time and persisted (pickle alongside `chroma_db/`).
2. **Reciprocal rank fusion** of BM25 and vector rankings (`score = Σ 1/(60 + rank)`); retrieve ~12 from each, fuse, return top-k (default 6).
3. **Fix IDs:** content-hash (`sha256(chunk_text)[:16]`) instead of positional index — re-chunking now correctly re-indexes changed content. Drop the private `_collection` access.
4. Record `embedding_model` in the Chroma collection metadata; assert it matches at query time.

**Tests:** RRF fusion math on synthetic rankings; an exact-token test — a query containing a term that appears verbatim in exactly one chunk must rank that chunk top-3.

**Acceptance:** on the real index, 5 exact-token queries ("priority entry", "s.72 burdens", a Form name, etc.) each retrieve the right paragraph in the top 3.

---

## Phase 4 — Generation polish (Tue 7, evening)

1. Citation format becomes `[Handbook, para 3.2.1, p.87]` sourced from chunk metadata; update the system prompt and the source-extraction regex together.
2. Add a tested **refusal path**: a question the handbook cannot answer ("What is the CGT rate?") must produce an explicit "not covered in the source material" response, not a guess.
3. Surface retrieval scores in CLI output (`--verbose`) so you can see *why* an answer cited what it cited.

**Acceptance:** 3 real questions answered with correct para+page citations verified against the PDF; 2 out-of-corpus questions correctly refused.

---

## Phase 5 — Evaluation harness (Wed 8, evening; write questions at lunch)

1. `eval/golden_set.jsonl` — ~25 questions **you write from your actual work**, each with the expected section number(s). Mix: 15 direct ("what does the handbook say about X"), 5 exact-token, 5 out-of-corpus (expected answer: refusal).
2. `python -m src.pipeline eval` — computes **retrieval hit@k** (expected section in top-k) and refusal accuracy; prints a table; writes `eval/results.md`.
3. One tuning iteration: try chunk-size and k variants, keep the winner, log the numbers.

**Acceptance:** hit@6 ≥ 80% on in-corpus questions; 5/5 refusals correct. If below, the results table tells you whether chunking or retrieval is the culprit — fix the bigger one, re-run, stop. **Do not tune past Wednesday.**

---

## Superseded (was Phase 6 — Portfolio surface): content moved to Phase 11

> This section's original scope (README rewrite, demo recording, decisions.md completeness,
> fresh-clone test) is superseded by the new Phase 6 (v1 freeze) and folded into
> **Phase 11 — portfolio surface** below. Body kept for reference only — `/phase-gate 6` must
> resolve against the new Phase 6, not this one.

1. **README rewrite** — the most-read artefact in the repo: what/why (the real workplace problem), architecture diagram (ASCII fine), quickstart that works from `git clone` in ≤5 commands, the eval results table, honest limitations, roadmap (matter-scoped deployment vision).
2. 2–3 minute screen recording: index → ask 3 questions → show citations → show a refusal → show eval output.
3. `docs/decisions.md` complete — every D-entry filled in.
4. Fresh-clone test: new venv, follow your own README verbatim. If it breaks, fix the README.

---

## Freeze + submission track

> **Superseded** by the two-track plan (Phases 6–12 below, see "Two-track remediation" after
> Phase 12): the 11 Jul external critique triggered a v1 freeze + v2 production-hardening split.
> Original single-track dates kept below for the record.

- **Fri 10:** code freeze. Hand repo + demo to PhD reviewer. Switch fully to essays.
- **Sat 11:** incorporate feedback (docs/small fixes only — no new features), essays final.
- **Sun 12:** submit.

**Parallel track (not optional):** AI Fluency + Claude 101 modules done by **Sun 5**. Essay drafts (community impact: colleagues adopting the S.150 skill; setback: your call) exist by **Wed 8** — a fellowship application is essays *and* project, weighted accordingly.

## Cut list (pre-agreed, in order, if behind schedule)
1. Tuning iteration in Phase 5 (keep the harness, skip optimisation)
2. Refusal-path *tests* (keep the behaviour)
3. BM25 persistence (rebuild index at query time — slower, works)
4. Screen recording (README screenshots instead)

**Never cut:** page-aware citations, the golden set, the README.

---

## Two-track remediation (Phases 6–12 supersede the tail above)

An external critique (11 Jul 2026) verified against the code: grounding was checked but not
enforced at the output boundary; the 90% eval headline conflated related-section matching with
exact retrieval and was tuned on its own question set; re-indexing without `--reset` leaves stale
chunks; `is_refusal` accepted hedged answers; appendix citations were invisible to the citation
extractor. Response (see `docs/decisions.md` D32–D33 onward): freeze today as v1 — honest,
fail-visible, not fail-closed — then implement the critique properly for v2 (fail-closed grounding
gate, auditability, held-out eval) by 13 Jul, and decide on the 13th which to submit.

## Phase 6 — v1 freeze: honesty + safety minimum (Fri 11 Jul, ~3.5–4.5h) — `phase-6-v1-freeze`

**Design:** scope discipline is fail-visible, not fail-closed. No gate module, no appendix work, no
lifecycle work — anything running past its timebox defers to its v2 phase.

1. **Zero-citation warning** (`src/pipeline.py` `query()`): a non-refusal answer with empty
   `citations` prints a prominent "WARNING: this answer contains no citations and could not be
   verified — treat as unverified."
2. **Always-print ungrounded warnings**: move the ungrounded block out of `if verbose:` so it
   always shows.
3. **Strict refusal matching** (`src/generator.py` `is_refusal`): normalized exact match — strip
   whitespace + surrounding quotes + trailing period, casefold, compare to `REFUSAL_PHRASE`.
   Evaluator imports it, so eval inherits the stricter definition.
4. **Eval labeling + provenance** (`src/evaluator.py`): per-question `hit_strict` (exact
   section-number equality) alongside existing `hit_related` (dotted-nesting); report shows both,
   strict first, labeled "n=30 tuning set — used to select fusion constants (D31); NOT held-out."
   `collect_provenance()` records git SHA + dirty flag, indexed chunk count, embedding model,
   generation model, and the matching definitions; `_format_report` adds top_k, golden path +
   per-type counts, and the refusals-skipped flag from its own arguments. Injectable `provenance_fn`
   keeps tests IO-free.
5. **Embedding cache** (timeboxed 20 min): `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)` on
   `get_embedding_function()`. Revert and defer to Phase 9 if anything fights it.
6. **Re-run eval on the real index** (retrieval offline; refusal pass = 5 live calls under the
   strict matcher). Report the honest number even if strict matching drops a live refusal —
   do not loosen the matcher to protect the metric. Commit regenerated `eval/results.md`.
7. **README honest interim rewrite**: drop the "corpus-agnostic" overclaim; real quickstart with
   the corpus-not-distributable caveat; eval table with both strict and related hit@6, labeled;
   short honest limitations list.
8. **Extend this file** with Phases 6–12, and physically rename the old
   "Phase 6 — Portfolio surface" heading (done above) so `/phase-gate 6` locks onto this Phase 6,
   not the old one.
9. **Gate + tag:** `/phase-gate 6`, PR, merge; tag `v1.0-pre-critique` on `17d23b1` and
   `v1.0-baseline` on the merge commit; push both tags.

**Tests:** hedged-phrase answer NOT a refusal / exact-phrase-with-period IS; zero-citation warning
printed (capsys) and absent for refusals; ungrounded warning without `--verbose`; strict-vs-related
divergence fixture (expected `14.12`, retrieved `14.12.1` → related hit, strict miss); provenance
from injected fake; existing suite green.
**decisions.md:** D32 (fail-visible warnings + strict refusal semantics), D33 (dual-metric labeling
+ provenance; strict becomes the headline basis going forward).
**Acceptance:** full suite green; live citation-free non-refusal shows the warning; eval/results.md
carries strict AND related rates plus provenance (git SHA, chunk count, both model names); both
tags exist on origin.

---

## Phase 7 — appendix citations end-to-end (Sat am, ~2h) — `phase-7-appendix-citations`

**Design:** must precede the grounding gate — today an appendix-only-cited answer extracts zero
citations and would be wrongly blocked. 4 golden questions expect APPENDIX sections.

1. **Fix `_handbook_header`** (retriever.py:143-155): `section_number.startswith("APPENDIX")` →
   emit verbatim, no `para` token — mirrors `chunker._prefix`, one locator grammar everywhere.
2. **Extend `CITATION_RE`** (generator.py, ~the `CITATION_RE = re.compile(` line): alternation `para <digits>` OR
   `APPENDIX <d+.d+>` (case-tolerant on the token); normalize into the existing dict shape (`para`
   key holds `"3.2.1"` or canonical `"APPENDIX 14.1"`).
3. **Extend `_sections_related`**: appendix-ness must match on both sides — `"14.1"` never relates
   to `"APPENDIX 14.1"`; both-appendix → strip prefix, existing component-nesting rule; mixed →
   False. `_citation_matches_chunk` + eval hit@k inherit automatically.
4. Live spot-check: golden Q22 (Gas Act wayleaves) — appendix citation appears in sources and
   grounds.

**Tests:** header rendering (no "para", verbatim); extraction in compact + long D21 bracket forms;
appendix citation grounds against appendix chunk; para/appendix cross-match False both directions;
lowercase "Appendix" extracts; eval hit against `["APPENDIX 14.1"]`.
**decisions.md:** D34 (appendix locators first-class; never-cross-match rule).
**Acceptance:** suite green; live Q22 shows grounded appendix citation; malformed header gone.

---

## Phase 8 — grounding gate + audit trail (Sat pm, ~3h) — `phase-8-grounding-gate`

1. **New `src/grounding.py`** — `classify(answer, citations, citation_check)` → `REFUSAL` /
   `GROUNDED` (≥1 citation, zero ungrounded) / `PARTIALLY_GROUNDED` (≥1 grounded AND ≥1 ungrounded)
   / `UNGROUNDED` (non-refusal, zero grounded — includes zero-citation). Called inside
   `generate_with_sources` → `result["gate_outcome"]` reaches every consumer; display policy stays
   in pipeline.py.
2. **Fail-closed display** (`pipeline.query`): GROUNDED → answer + citations + "verified" note.
   PARTIALLY_GROUNDED → answer shown, ungrounded citations under a warning banner. UNGROUNDED →
   answer withheld, banner "BLOCKED — UNVERIFIED" (wording says grounding *could not be verified*,
   never "not in the corpus"), retrieved source headers (section + pages only) shown, hints to
   rephrase / `--top-k` / `--show-unverified`. `--show-unverified` reveals the draft under an
   "UNVERIFIED DRAFT" banner, flagged in the audit record. Returned dict always carries the full
   answer; only CLI display is gated. `query()` reads `gate_outcome` with a defined fallback for
   legacy/missing results; the two existing `test_pipeline.py` mocks get `gate_outcome` added.
   Extend `/phase-gate`'s hygiene check to cover `logs/` alongside `data/`/`*.pdf`/`.env`/`chroma_db/`.
3. **New `src/audit.py`** — `log_event(record, path)` append-only JSONL
   (`logs/audit_log.jsonl`, `AUDIT_LOG_PATH` env override); record: timestamp, git SHA, query text,
   top_k, type filter, retrieved `[{id, section_number, page_start, page_end, score}]`,
   `gate_outcome`, `action` (`shown`/`shown_with_warning`/`blocked_unverified`/`refusal_shown`/
   `shown_unverified_override`), grounded/ungrounded counts, citation locators, generation model,
   `answer_chars`. Answer text and chunk text excluded (copyright). Always-on in `pipeline.query`.
   Add `logs/` to `.gitignore`.

**Tests:** classification matrix (refusal / zero-citation / all-grounded / mixed / appendix-only);
capsys: UNGROUNDED withholds body + shows sources, override reveals with banner + audit flag,
PARTIALLY shows banner; audit line has expected keys, no answer/chunk text, appends (tmp_path);
generation seams patched — no live calls.
**decisions.md:** D35 (gate semantics + block-and-show-sources rationale), D36 (audit record
contents; why text is excluded).
**Acceptance:** suite green; live in-corpus Q → GROUNDED + shown; citation-stripped answer →
withheld with sources; one well-formed audit line per query; `git status` clean of `logs/`.

---

## Phase 9 — index lifecycle + load-once retrieval (Sat eve, ~2h) — `phase-9-index-lifecycle`

1. **Per-source transactional replace** — new `sync_documents(documents, vector_store=None,
   persist_directory=None)` in `src/embedder.py` (`add_documents` stays insert-only): group by
   `metadata["source"]`; per source, delete stale content-hash ids no longer present; rebuild BM25
   sidecar + manifest whenever `stale or new_docs` (fixes the trap where a delete-only re-sync
   leaves deleted chunks in BM25). `pipeline.index_documents` switches to `sync_documents`;
   `--reset` retained for full rebuilds.
2. **Retriever injection** — `retrieve(query, ..., vector_store=None, bm25_index=None)`; skip
   store/BM25 construction when injected. Evaluator's default `retrieve_fn`/`answer_fn` build once
   and close over them (eval currently reloads MiniLM 35×); `pipeline.query` passes a once-built
   store. Land the Phase 6 `lru_cache` here if it was deferred.

**Tests:** index → mutate one chunk → re-sync → stale ID absent from store AND from BM25 results
(the trap test); unchanged chunks not re-embedded (ID set stable); two sources don't delete each
other; injected store/bm25 used without disk loads (monkeypatch counters).
**decisions.md:** D37 (per-source replace semantics; `add_documents` stays insert-only; BM25
delete-rebuild trap).
**Acceptance:** suite green; real corpus: re-index without `--reset` → chunk count equals fresh
`--reset` build; retrieval-only eval wall-clock measurably down (record before/after).

---

## Phase 10 — Eval v2: honest, held-out, ablated (Sun am, ~4h) — `phase-10-eval-v2`

**Prerequisite** (Fri 11 night, human, ~1h, no pipeline runs, no peeking): author
`eval/heldout_set.jsonl` — 15–20 fresh in-corpus questions (direct + exact_token, verified against
the PDF, never used in tuning) + 5–8 near-domain refusal hard negatives, each grepped against the
PDF text before locking in (the handbook has tax/family-home/lease chapters that could make a
candidate negative actually in-corpus). Same schema; `load_golden_set` reused unchanged.

1. **Ablation plumbing:** `retrieve(..., mode="hybrid"|"vector"|"bm25")` selects what feeds RRF.
2. **Metrics:** hit@1/3/6 in strict AND related bases + MRR (first strict / first related match),
   from one retrieval at k=6 per question.
   - **Carry-over from Phase 6 (pressure-tester footgun):** `run_eval` ALWAYS overwrites
     `results_path` (default `eval/results.md`), even under `--skip-refusals` — so an offline/CI run
     silently degrades the canonical report (drops the live 5/5 refusal line). Add a `--results`/`-o`
     CLI flag (and/or refuse to overwrite the default path when refusals are skipped) so CI and
     ad-hoc offline runs write elsewhere. This is the natural home for the fix (eval CLI is already
     gaining `--skip-completeness`/`--judge` here); Phase 11 CI depends on it.
3. **Runner + report:** each mode × each set (tuning, held-out) → full table; provenance extended
   with mode + set hashes; headline = strict hit@6 on held-out; ablation table; per-question
   detail; sets labeled "tuning (used for D31)" vs "held-out (never tuned)".
4. **Answer-generation pass (shared):** generate once for in-corpus questions; feed both the
   citation-completeness metrics (sentence-citation coverage, citation-grounded fraction,
   gate-outcome distribution) and the judge below.
5. **`--judge` (experimental, off by default):** per generated answer, one judge call over the
   retrieved context → per-claim supported/unsupported/unclear + mean faithfulness, reported as
   "LLM-judged faithfulness estimate"; judge model + prompt version + config recorded in
   provenance; `--judge-sample N` if time is tight, disclosed in the report; ≥5-answer manual
   spot-review noted.
6. **Sub-chunking decision gate (decide, don't build):** write D39 from the ablation numbers — if
   vector-only related-hit@6 is within ~10 pts of hybrid, defer multi-vector post-submission; if
   materially weak, the sanctioned lever is lowering the oversize-chunk threshold + re-index, not a
   multi-vector build.
7. Full eval on real corpus; commit reports (D30 scrub rule: no corpus prose).

**Tests:** mode selection via fakes; strict/related + MRR math on synthetic rankings; hit@1 ≤ hit@3
≤ hit@6 property; splitter + completeness on fixed fake answers; both-set report rendering
(injected fakes); judge prompt construction with mocked LLM. All IO injected.
**decisions.md:** D38 (eval v2 design: held-out strict headline, never-tune-on-held-out protocol),
D39 (sub-chunking go/no-go with pasted ablation numbers).
**Acceptance:** committed report has provenance; strict+related hit@{1,3,6}+MRR for 3 modes × 2
sets; refusal accuracy incl. near-domain negatives; completeness metrics; judge estimate (or
disclosed subset); D39 recorded with evidence.

---

## Phase 11 — portfolio surface (Sun pm, ~3h) — `phase-11-portfolio-surface`

1. **Synthetic sample corpus:** `scripts/sample_corpus.py` — copyright-safe ~15-page synthetic
   handbook (2–3 chapters, nested sections, one APPENDIX, a false-positive trap line), standalone
   from test fixtures. `scripts/build_sample_index.py`: text → `chunk_handbook` → `sync_documents`
   → `./chroma_db`. Plus `eval/sample_golden_set.jsonl` (5–8 questions incl. one appendix
   expectation).
2. **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): job 1 — ubuntu, Python 3.12, pip cache, `pytest tests/ -q`;
   job 2 (smoke) — build sample index, `eval --golden eval/sample_golden_set.jsonl
   --skip-refusals --skip-completeness`. No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in CI — offline paths only.
3. **LICENSE:** MIT; README states it covers code only, corpus never distributed.
4. **README final:** what/why; ASCII architecture diagram (ingest → chunk → hybrid index → RRF →
   generate → grounding gate → audit log); fresh-clone quickstart via sample corpus; honest eval
   table (held-out strict headline, ablations); data-handling section; firm-deployment notes;
   limitations; troubleshooting; demo script; roadmap.
5. **Fresh-clone verification:** clone to scratch dir, new venv, follow README verbatim; fix README
   where it breaks.

**Tests:** sample builder yields expected chunks/sections/one appendix via `chunk_handbook`
(offline).
**decisions.md:** D40 (sample-corpus mechanism), D41 (MIT + scope note).
**Acceptance:** fresh clone passes quickstart offline; CI green on the PR; README complete per
above.

---

## Phase 12 — final gate + v1-vs-v2 decision (Sun eve, ~1.5–2h) — on main

1. `/phase-gate` over v2 (full suite, pressure-tester, high-effort code review, hygiene: nothing
   tracked in `data/`, `*.pdf`, `.env`, `chroma_db/`, `logs/`).
2. Re-run full Phase 10 eval at v2 HEAD (live refusals + completeness; `--judge` per user opt-in);
   commit.
3. **`docs/v1-v2-comparison.md`:** metric table (v1 numbers from `eval/results.md` at the
   `v1.0-baseline` tag) + feature table (gate, appendix citations, lifecycle, audit, provenance,
   held-out eval, CI, LICENSE, README). State honestly if v2's held-out strict headline is lower
   than v1's related-basis 0.900 — lower-but-honest is the expected, defensible outcome.
4. Submission decision recorded as **D42** (recommendation: v2 if the gate passes; `v1.0-baseline`
   stays the fallback). Tag `v2.0`; push.

**Acceptance:** gate PASS; comparison doc committed; D42 records the decision; chosen artifact
tagged + pushed.

---

## Cut list (v2)

**Cut order if behind:** judge pass → MRR/hit@1,3 → CI smoke job → completeness metric → demo
polish.
**Never cut:** fail-closed gate, appendix support, per-source replace (with BM25 rebuild), held-out
set, strict labeling + provenance, honest README, `v1.0-baseline` tag.

## Two-track git strategy

Tags freeze a fixed commit (`v1.0-pre-critique` on `17d23b1`, `v1.0-baseline` on the Phase 6 merge
commit, `v2.0` on main after Phase 12 if v2 is chosen); branches are movable pointers meant to keep
receiving commits, so freezing v1 for later comparison calls for a tag, not a branch — if a v1
hotfix is ever needed, a branch can still be cut from the tag afterwards. Day-to-day work continues
on the existing convention (branch `phase-N-slug` → PR → merge after user "go"), with phase
branches stacked from the previous phase's branch on Saturday so work isn't blocked waiting for
each PR's merge approval.
